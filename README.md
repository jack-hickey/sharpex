# Sharpex
Sharpex is an extension library that aims to reduce the workload required by developers utilizing the .NET framework.

Some methods that are wrapped in this library are ones that are often written into applications anyway, and provide an easier-to-use framework. Others however, exist to streamline the process and ensure that you as the developer don't need to worry about writing the code yourself and constantly try to optimize it.
